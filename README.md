# [Austin Serb - Web Developer Portfolio](https://www.austinserb.com/) - Nextjs, React Zero UI



![austin-serb-portoflio-website-front-end-engineer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68aaf3f3-ec9b-4186-ac31-77f6288bc5d3) 
 

This portfolio started as a personal technical challenge. I wanted to take a design direction I loved and rebuild it the way a **modern software engineer** would: with Next.js, React Server Components, and a zero-re-render approach to complex animations.

A major creative spark for this project came from the Webflow/Framer site **“Launchfolio” by Joseph Alexander**
[https://launchfolio.framer.website/](https://launchfolio.framer.website/)

Joseph’s work is incredible and set a visual bar that pushed me to explore what the same feel could perform like when rebuilt from scratch using real engineering practices. My goal wasn’t to replicate it, but to push myself technically while staying in conversation with that aesthetic.

So this project became a playground for:

* A fully custom Next.js 15 build
* My Zero Re-render [UI State-management library React Zero UI](https://github.com/react-zero-ui/core) 
* Zero re-render animation patterns
* Performance testing under heavy interaction
* Making animations that actually work on mobile
* Understanding the limits of server and client composition

I learned a ton building it, and I hope others can learn from it as well.

### Usage Guidelines

I’m sharing this repo publicly because I believe real-world examples help developers grow faster.
You’re absolutely welcome to:

* Read through the code
* Explore the layout ideas
* Study how the animation system works
* Borrow patterns and approaches
* Apply concepts to your own style

However, I ask that you **don’t clone or repurpose this portfolio directly**.

It’s simply important to me that the design and structure don’t end up as a sea of lookalikes online.

This project represents many hours of work and my engineering philosophy. I want to keep that identity intact.

So Please:

* Learn from it
* Build your own version
* Take inspiration and evolve it
* Put the Work/Time in

Please Do NOT
* Use this repo as a drop-in template for your portfolio
* Ship a 1:1 copy of the code
* Clone the identity

### A Note on Respecting Inspiration

Since this project itself was HEAVILY inspired by Joseph Alexander’s Launchfolio concept, I’m especially aware of how design influence flows across the web. Inspiration is healthy. Cloning is not.

As long as you’re learning and creating something new from this repository, I’m 100 percent supportive.

### Final Thoughts

This portfolio is here to inspire, teach, and challenge your engineering instincts.
If it helps you become a better developer, it already accomplished what I wanted.
